\section{Cluster monitoring}

The NTU HPC cluster uses Ganglia to collect metrics for monitoring purposes. It also has a Grafana dashboard as frontend for metric visualization. The dashboard can be accessed at http://grafana.ntuhpc.org anonymously. On the site, please select the dashboard \textit{NTU HPC cluster}. By default, the dashboard shows metrics for all nodes in the cluster. To display metrics for a single node, you can change the \textit{node} variable at the top left corner.
